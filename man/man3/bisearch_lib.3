.TH bisearch_lib 3 "binary search functions"
.SH NAME
BISearch \- functions that search for intervals in monotonic arrays
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fBint BISearch(double\fP \fIval\fP, \fBdouble\fP *\fIbnds\fP, \fBint\fP \fIn_bnds\fP\fB);\fP
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBBiSearch\fP searches array \fIbnds\fP of \fIn_bnds\fP elements for an interval
containing \fIval\fP.  Array \fIbnds\fP must be monotonic.
If \fIbnds\fP is increasing, return value \fIi\fP satisfies
\fIbnds\fP\fB[\fP\fIi\fP\fB]\fP\ \fB<=\fP\ \fIval\fP\ \fB<\fP\ \fIbnds\fP\fB[\fP\fIi\fP\fB+1]\fP.
If \fIbnds\fP is decreasing, return value \fIi\fP satisfies
\fIbnds\fP\fB[\fP\fIi\fP\fB]\fP\ \fB>=\fP\ \fIval\fP\ \fB>\fP\ \fIbnds\fP\fB[\fP\fIi\fP\fB+1]\fP.
A return value of \fB-1\fP indicates \fIval\fP is not contained in any interval
in \fIbnds\fP.
